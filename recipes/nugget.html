        <p>I chose this dish as my third dish because of its simplicity. It is the easiest to make out of the three, because it's literally just rice, with nuggets where you put in open and let it cook for 35minutes while you can do other things in the meantime, and with sauces bought from grocery store, and that's it! It's a comfortable/nostalgic meal, as this would be the meal I'd love the most back in high school when I bring food back from home</p>
